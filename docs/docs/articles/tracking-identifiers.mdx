# Tracking identifiers playground

This document simulates session creating logic depending on the 3rd party tool. As such it does not reflect the current state of d8a.

## Tracking Identifiers

See [glossary](./glossary.md) for more details.

## Tracking Settings

Tracking-related settings that may influence which and how identifiers may be used and thus how sessions are calculated.

| Setting | Default | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Use cookies for tracking | true | Effectively turns on or off the usage of Client ID identifier. If the cookies are disabled, each Client ID may contain a different value |
| Use Session stamp | true | Turns off the usage of SS identifier. If the Client ID changes (for example by cleaning cookies), we have no way of binding events before and after the change, effectively creating two sessions instead of one |
| Use CASI | false | Turns on or off the usage of CASI when calculating sessions |

## Tracking Conditions

Overall the tracker will attempt to track whatever is being delivered. We offload the privacy-related decisions to the tag manager.

| Condition | GA4-compatible | Matomo-compatible |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Visitor did give consent | There is [consent](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/protocol/ga4/reference?client_type=firebase) attribute, but it only contains info about google ads and personalization params. Not sure about consent for analytics. There are two consent modes in GA, one sends only simple pings, other sends nothing | Nothing in the documentation. The tag is not fired at all if no consent is given for Matomo, meaning no data if no consent |
| Visitor did not give consent | Attempt to track whavever is being delivered. Attempt to match the hits by SS to de-anonymize them after the consent is eventually granted. | Depends on tag manager, track whatever is being delivered |

## Interactive Scenarios

Try different combinations of settings to see how they affect tracking and session behavior:
