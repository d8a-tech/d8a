# Linting

- If I ask you to fix linter errs, please fix only simple errors like lack of comment, unchecked error, lll (line lenght), etc - anything that can be solved with adding docstring and reformatting without changing logic 
- Complex thinkgs like mccabe, funlen, etc leave to me, unless I specifically ask you to fix given error. 
- If a method is exported just to satisfy the interface, the method comment should be just // X implements Y, where X is method, Y is the interface name (package.Interface)
- ONLY IN TEST CODE mccabe, cognitive complexity (gocoginit or somth) and funlen can be //nolinted
- If the linter complains about unchecked errors in deferred functions, wrap in anonymous func with logrus.Error
- You can check linter by ussing cd src/<project> && ~/go/bin/golangci-lint run ./..., where project is tracker-api, core-api, etc, depends on current context
- If you execute the linters for nth time, skip `cd src/<project>` - you're already in the directory, previous command got you there
