# Testing rules

- When it's necessary, use testify.Mock, but if the interface is not a huge one, prefer writing own simple mocks
- When writing tests use array-driven approach, testify.assert and // given // when // then approach. 
- When writing tests - very important: do not blindly write tests to satisfy the current logic, if you suspect the current logic contains errors, that the tests should reveal, ask me for opinion.
